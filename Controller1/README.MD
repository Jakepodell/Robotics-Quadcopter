#The Controller
###This controller was developed by Jake Podell under the supervision of Mr. Slater. It serves as a multipurpose radio controller for any project. Applications include:

+ Game Control
+ Remote Control Car
+ Flying Machine Control

The controller comes loaded with the "Controller_Send" file uploaded to it. This file was designed to be modified and re-uploaded.

The "Controller_Receive" file was made to be uploaded to a paired Arduino Uno attached to a radio unit. It will recieve all of the values for further manipulation.

*Note- Printing the values from the joysticks to the serial monitor produces lag.

The controller is based off an Arduino Uno, powered by 4 rechargable double A batteries. The controller includes 2 potentiometer based joysticks, one of which has a toggle push button There are two leds on the device- one to indicate power and the other to indicate the right joystick toggle. In the bottom of the controller is the Arduino Port, and at the top is the radio transmitter. The radio used can be found here. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/705.
